You may gain extra speed, damage, attack speed, damage resistance, healing boost, arrow shoot speed, and arrow damage.

You may also add food that can break the preset limit.

if one of the attributes is x,

Damage resistance works in the form : y = y0/(1+x)

Other works in the form : y = y0*(1+x)

Notice: this mod maybe overpowered if you don't arrange your diet carefully.
