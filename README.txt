A mod designed to encourage trying legendary foods.

Add a food to the config file, or turn off the whitelist in the config file, so that you can get stronger after eating.(Once for each food)

You may gain extra speed, damage, attack speed, damage resistance, healing boost, arrow shoot speed, and arrow damage.

You may also add food that can break the preset limit.

You can modify the config file so that food can provide effects while eaten, related to status they provide. (Don't have to be the first time)

Two effects(Shootspeed Up/Arrow DMG Up) are added, providing 30% arrow speed/arrow base damge for each level.

if one of the attributes is x,

Damage resistance works in the form : y = y0/(1+x)

Other works in the form : y = y0*(1+x)

Notice: this mod maybe overpowered if you don't arrange your diet carefully.
